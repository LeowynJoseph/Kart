# v3.0.1 ~ vscode-liquid

This is a patch release version. As per #100 the defaults applied that automatically set `editor.formatOnSave` to Liquid CSS, Liquid SCSS and Liquid JavaScript are now opt-in. This prevents the extension form running unexpectedly on folks workspaces which have upgraded but not read documentation of release notes.

## Notes

### Frontmatter

The initial release did not support frontmatter during beautification. Prettify does not yet support frontmatter beautification so triple dashed delimiter regions are ignored by default until support is made possible.

### Fixed JSON inherited Rules

JSON rules were not being applied correctly, this patch also fixes that.
