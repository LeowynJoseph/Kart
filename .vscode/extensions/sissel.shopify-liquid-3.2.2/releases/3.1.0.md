# v3.1.1 ~ vscode-liquid

This release irons out a lots bugs in the initial [v3.0.0](https://github.com/panoply/vscode-liquid/releases/edit/v3.0.0) release and includes some addition features.

### Fixed various formatting defects

Various defects were fixed that were apparent in **v3.0.0** - Things should be a lot less aggressive now. There is still a lot more work to be done on this front but things are getting more stable. The goal before next **minor** is to iron out and refine configuration IntelliSense. This is a lot of work, so stay tuned.

### Improved Syntax Highlighting

The Liquid grammars have been improved and refined. As per #105 the new syntax highlighting supports **type** scopes and will apply coloring to objects and object properties which reflect the referenced type, for example:

Big thanks to @muchisx who spent a considerable amount of time to report of inform on the various scopes and issues. Great stuff.

### Added 14 more completions

This release includes some additional Shopify object completions. Completions is a new capability to this extension and is something that will be refined as it reaches closer to the official Liquify supersede. I will soon open source the [Liquid Language Specification](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@liquify/liquid-language-specs) package which is responsible from making the completions possible and will be hoping keen contributors will assist in ensuring the Shopify specs include the most recent API for Liquid.
